Technology Partners: Software and Hardware
CarSim, BikeSim, and TruckSim work well with other software. You can extend the vehicle math models with other simulation tools, perform optimization/DOE (design of experiment), run tests with hardware-in-the-loop (HIL), and other activities involve simulating vehicle response. This page lists major partners who provide modeling/optimization software and services, and HIL test systems.

Companies that can measure vehicle and tire data are listed here.

Extending, Modeling and Optimization
You can extend the well-established vehicle math models with other simulation tools to add advanced controllers, perform optimization/DOE (design of experiment), run tests with hardware-in-the-loop (HIL), and other activities involve simulating vehicle response.
