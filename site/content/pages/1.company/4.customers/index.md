Since the founding of Mechanical Simulation in 1996, CarSim has become the most widely used system-level vehicle dynamics simulation software in the automotive industry. CarSim has gradually displaced some of the "in house" vehicle dynamics programs used by OEM's and their suppliers, and has become the software of choice for many companies as they start using simulation to improve their development process.

The list of customers has grown to the extent that separate pages are provided for our vehicle simulation products (BikeSim, CarSim, and TruckSim), with a separate page for universities.
