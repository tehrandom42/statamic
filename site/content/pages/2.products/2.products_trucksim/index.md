    text: '<p>TruckSim delivers the most accurate, detailed, and efficient methods for simulating the performance of multi-axle commercial and military vehicles. With more than twenty years of real-world validation, TruckSim is universally the preferred tool for analyzing vehicle dynamics, developing active controllers, calculating a truckâ€™s performance characteristics, and engineering next-generation active safety systems.</p><p>Current version: 2019.1</p><h2>TruckSim Advantages</h2><p>CarSim, TruckSim, and BikeSim are used worldwide by over 110 OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers and over 200 universities and government research labs. Here are some reasons why so many engineers have selected TruckSim:</p><ol><li>TruckSim is a standalone application. It does not require any other software to perform simulations.</li><li>TruckSim has a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.carsim.com/products/supporting/simulink/index.php">standard interface</a>&nbsp;to MATLAB/Simulink.</li><li>TruckSim allows users to build complex scenarios and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.carsim.com/products/supporting/vehiclesim/vs_commands.php">test event sequences</a>.</li><li>TruckSim supports:<ol><br><li>Software-in-the-loop</li><li>Model-in-the-loop</li><li>Hardware-in-the-loop</li><li>Driver-in-the-loop</li></ol></li><li>TruckSim has an intuitive&nbsp;<a href="https://www.carsim.com/products/supporting/sgui/index.php">user interface</a>&nbsp;and powerful analysis tools (see for the video in the sidebar).</li><li>TruckSim supports vehicle&nbsp;<a href="https://www.carsim.com/products/objects_sensors/index.php">sensors and interactive traffic</a>&nbsp;for V2V and ADAS development.</li><li>TruckSim includes over 2100 pages of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.carsim.com/products/supporting/sgui/index.php">indexed documentation</a>&nbsp;covering all aspects of the software.</li><li>TruckSim includes numerous example vehicles, roads, and procedures to assist first-time users.</li><li>TruckSim is economical in comparison to other commercial vehicle dynamics software tools.</li></ol><h2>VehicleSim Technology</h2><p>CarSim, BikeSim, and TruckSim all use technology first introduced in 1990 and developed continuously since then.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.carsim.com/products/supporting/vehiclesim/index.php">Efficient parametric math models</a>&nbsp;reproduce system-level vehicle dynamics behavior, under the control of a GUI intended for engineers who need to evaluate vehicle/controller behavior without spending weeks of training. VehicleSim products also include the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.carsim.com/products/supporting/view/index.php">VS Visualizer tool</a>&nbsp;for viewing simulations with plots and photo-realistic animation.</p><p>In addition to the built-in capabilities of the TruckSim models, the VehicleSim software tools include methods to extend the capabilities with user-defined programs and/or connections to third-party software:</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.carsim.com/products/supporting/simulink/index.php">Commercial simulation environments</a>&nbsp;Simulink (the MathWorks), LabVIEW (National Instruments), and ASCET (ETAS).</li><li>Simulation environents that support the Functional Mockup Interface (FMI); TruckSim can automatically generate&nbsp;<a href="https://www.carsim.com/products/supporting/simulink/index.php">Functional Mockup Units</a>&nbsp;(FMUs) that work in many external software environments.</li><li><a href="https://www.carsim.com/products/supporting/vehiclesim/vs_commands.php">VS Commands</a>&nbsp;(the built-in scripting language).</li><li>Run with custom programs (MATLAB, Visual Basic, C/C++) using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.carsim.com/products/supporting/vehiclesim/vs_api.php">VS API (application program interface)</a>.</li><li>Run with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.carsim.com/products/supporting/automation/index.php">remote control via Windows COM</a>&nbsp;and other methods</li><li>Support of HIL (hardware in the loop) testing on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.carsim.com/products/realtime/index.php">major RT (real time) platforms</a>.</li><li>Support of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.carsim.com/products/ds/index.php">driving simulators</a>&nbsp;that use TruckSim as the RT vehicle math model.</li></ol><p>See the links in the sidebar for more information about the technology and simulation features available in TruckSim.</p><h2>Package Options</h2><p>Here is a PDF file describing the various&nbsp;<a href="https://www.carsim.com/downloads/pdf/TruckSim_Model_License_Options.pdf" target="_blank">TruckSim Model and License Options</a>.</p>'
