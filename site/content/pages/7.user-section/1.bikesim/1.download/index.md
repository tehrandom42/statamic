      In earlier versions of the BikeSim installer the Real-Time datasets were already contained as part of the standard database. In BikeSim 2019.1 the RT examples will need to be imported from BikeSim_Prog\Resources\Import_Examples.
      
      ### Installing the Software
      When you install the software the first time, you MUST log on as an administrator. If the end user account is not an administrator, be sure to install the BikeSim data folder in a location with write permission for the end user.
      
      The installer includes the BikeSim programs, the example BikeSim database, and some other components (License Information, NI CVI Engine, Dongle Driver, OpenAL, Adobe Reader). The default options are checked. If you are not sure about a component, it's usually best to install it.
      
      Options for making new runs depend on your license (Basic, +Sensors). For example, you cannot make a new run for a vehicle with sensors unless you have a BikeSim Sensors license.
      
      You may use the installer without administrator permissions any time you wish to install a new copy of the database. For this reason, we recommend that all users keep a copy of the installer.
      
      ### Getting Started
      If you have not used BikeSim recently, please go through the **BikeSim Quick Start Guide** (updated June 2018).
