Resources for Users
Much of the content on the carsim.com site is introductory, for visitors who are just learning about our software. This section contains resources for those of you who are already working with BikeSim, CarSim, SuspensionSim, or TruckSim.

This is where you download the installers for the current release. Each subsection has news about bugs and workarounds. There are pages for downloading installers for past versions, going back to about 2008, and there is an archive of all of the release notes documenting new features and bug fixes.

We recommend that you bookmark the page for your product and check it every once in a while for announcements about product updates, bug reports, fixes, and other news.
