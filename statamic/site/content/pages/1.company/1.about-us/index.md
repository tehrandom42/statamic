**About Mechanical Simulation Corporation**

Mechanical Simulation Corporation is the world leader in the development and distribution of advanced software used to simulate vehicle behavior involving interactions between the 3D dynamic vehicle response, advanced, controllers, driver controls, and 3D roads. Established in 1996, Mechanical Simulation provides car, truck and motorcycle simulation packages, training and ongoing support worldwide to more than 110 OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers, and over 200 universities and government research groups. We also provide the vehicle dynamics models used in more than 1400 driving simulators. The Ann Arbor, Michigan, headquarters coordinates with global sales agents who provide local distribution and tech support for our software.

The simulation structure for the software is called VehicleSim (VS). CarSim, TruckSim, and BikeSim are VehicleSim products that provide the most accurate and realistic predictions that are possible, in a form that can be easily used by most engineers and technical staff. Each package includes the VS Browser (GUI and database management), VS Visualizer (animation and plotting), on-line help, and VS Solver programs for the detailed math models. The math models run alone or with third-party simulation software such as Simulink, LabVIEW, ETAS ASCET, and others.

VS Solvers run on 32-bit and 64-bit Windows OS faster than real time, and are available on many third-part real-time systems for hardware in the loop (HIL) testing. The CarSim and TruckSim math models are also used in driving simulators, ranging from inexpensive PC-based systems to full-motion simulators.

SuspensionSim is the fourth VehicleSim product. While sharing the architecture, GUI, database, and visualization tools of the other products, it differs by providing a multibody program that calculates quasi-static equilibrium conditions for suspensions in cars, trucks, and motorcycles.
