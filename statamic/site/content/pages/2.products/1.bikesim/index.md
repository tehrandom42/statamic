BikeSim delivers the most accurate, detailed, and efficient methods for simulating the performance of two- and three-wheeled vehicles. With more than twenty years of real-world validation, BikeSim is universally the preferred tool for analyzing motorcycle dynamics, developing active controllers, calculating overall system performance, and engineering next generation active safety systems.

Current version: 2019.1

With manufacturers facing compressed product release cycles, BikeSim provides an intuitive set of tools for engineers to quickly evaluate complete motorcycles, sub-components, and active controllers in complex, simulated driving environments. As more companies and motorsports organizations embrace simulation based engineering, BikeSim provides a system- based modeling approach to help users focus on their area of expertise while keeping the rest of the simulation environment constant.
